TrollBox+
=========

TrollBox+ extends the functionality of the BTE-e.com TrollBox by allowing you to ignore users, star users so 
people you are interested in stand out and you can enable/disable the display of images in chat. Future features
to offer simplified trading commands.

TrollBox+ is free open source software. You are free to do with it as you wish, without restrictions. If you do
fork it and make a new release I just ask for a link back to this original version - but you don't have to. I also
don't mind donations. But again, you don't have to. I'll just trust your momma taught you to do the right thing :)
